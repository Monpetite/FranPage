        <p>Francisco Adrián (Valencia, 1994) psychologist and musician. At his young age he had the opportunity to
          travel to various countries in America and Europe. Fascinated by art (as he himself expresses it) he visits
          museums and galleries wherever he goes. He views the great classical and contemporary masters with great
          enthusiasm and excitement. La Maja desnuda by Francisco de Goya, hits him. The image represents a real woman
          and not a mythological figure. <br>
          <br>
          His sensitivity to art makes him fruitful and his restless youth leads him to explore in an experimental and
          personal way what art hides and reveals. <br>
          <br>
          Adrián, in his incipient work, is disciplined, instinctive, on the search for the sensible, the original and
          unrepeatable; aspects that art requires in order to project oneself as an artist.

        <p > De la excusa a lo íntimo. Entering into the labyrinth of art when traveling your own way, is also entering a
          universe of fictions and shadows, avoiding the ideas that become to materialize them. <br>
          <br>
          From his paintings I remember the body as the protagonist, defined by a sinuous, thick and marked line. A
          random background, without chiaroscuro or nuances, sometimes almost non-existent. I need the excuse to capture
          a repertoire of feelings and human figures at rest, barely taking off from the stillness. <br>
          <br>
          In his work, it is perceived how the looks intersect between painter and imaginary or real models. There is
          some intimate communication that leaves the bodies in the creative process, conceiving worlds as significant
          to them as to the viewer. <br>
          <br>
          Likewise, the background is subordinated to the line, the calligraphy determines the movement, the strength
          and the volume of the figure, the whites represent emptiness and complement the dynamics of the artist's
          language. <br>
          <br>
          Entering the plastic story that Adrián offers is simple. The suggestive bodily attitude of his figures, the
          encountering glances, the extended brushstrokes, the flat colors, the rounded and thick lines evoking sensuality, the force in the line, the horizontality or
          verticality of the represented object, the directional sense of the work, between others. A whole set of
          elements that gives order to the space and gives coherence to its artistic approach. Losing yourself in the
          intimacy of your story is more complicated. <br>
          <br>
          The metaphor of the line in Adrián's work contributes and communicates the complex and subjective aspects of
          his shadow or construction experience. Recreates and gives new meanings to the represented object, evokes it
          in its own and different contexts. <br>
          <br>
          The self-portrait is a separate point. As well as being interesting in terms of the meanings it suggests close
          to the acts of idealization or narcissism. Contemplation of oneself, using a model, is also experiencing the
          reality or place of the other. By placing itself in the center, as an object that expresses tensions,
          pleasures, feelings and darkness in images of aesthetic beauty, it gives us part of the enigma that only time
          will clarify.

            so that, it has more acceptance and flexibility for the personal work of the
